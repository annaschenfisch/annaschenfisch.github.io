The [Fréchet distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_distance)
measures similarity between curves. It is oftened explained via metaphor as the
shortest leash length for which a person could walk along one curve and their
dog could walk along the other, where neither walker ever goes backwards.

Since the initial appearance of Fréchet distance, mathematicians have been
investigating variants, which often come with their own colorful stories of
walking and leashes. This includes (and is not limited to) 
<ul>
  <li>pairs of frogs (the typical metaphor for [discrete Fréchet
