This is a pun on [Tukey Depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey_depth), a
concept in computational geometry defined similarly, but for point sets rather
than sets of turkeys. In modern computational geometry, Tukey depth is most
commonly studied with the goal of finding efficient approximation algorithms,
particularly for high dimensions.
