The famous [handshaking
lemma](https://dev.to/adnauseum/handshaking-lemma-degree-sum-formula-419a)
(also known as the degree sum formula) states that, in a simple graph, the sum
of all degrees of all vertices in a graph is twice the number of edges. That
is, if you try to count edges by going through the vertices and writing down
how many edges are attached to each vertex, you'll end up counting each edge
twice.
