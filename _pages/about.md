I am a topologist and geometer, combining elements of pure math with
elements of computer science. My current research interests are in the algebraic
K-theory of persistence modules and shape representation using directional
topological descriptors. 

When I am not researching, teaching, or learning math, I love to trail run and
dance. TEST
