I am a topologist and geometer, combining elements of pure math with elements
of computer science. My main research interest is in directional
topological transforms, which represent shapes by recording how topological
invariants change throughout height-based filtrations of the shape. 

Other research interests include verbose topological descriptors, graph theory,
algebraic K-theory of persistence modules, and collaborating with other
disciplines to use computational geometry and topology in applications.

When I am not researching, teaching, or learning math, I love to trail run and
dance.
