I am a topologist and geometer, combining elements of pure math with elements
of computer science. My main research interest is in directional
topological transforms, which represent shapes by recording how topological
invariants change throughout height-based filtrations of the shape. 

Other research interests include the algebraic K-theory of persistence modules,
verbose topological descriptors, graph theory, and using computational geometry
in applications to river network extraction.

When I am not researching, teaching, or learning math, I love to trail run and
dance.
